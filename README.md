# Calendo Rewritten
Calendo was a project that I was a part of during the Winter Quarters of 2017. Because of the time constraint (2 weeks), a lot of stuff was hard coded and could do with some re work. This is how Calendo Rewritten was born.  

I really liked the idea behind our project. This is ultimately a test to see if my front end development skills have improved and also to give me a chance to actually start touching back end. Originally, we used Django as our backend, I might initially also go with that, but I also would like to try out MongoDB and maybe even MySQL and Firebase.
